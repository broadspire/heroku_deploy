heroku-deploy
=============

Deploy to multiple heroku apps (for different environments), making sure to use
a predefined stable branch. This will inspect your current git remotes to figure
the name of the tasks. So for example, if you have a remote named 'production'
poiting to 'git@heroku.com:my-awesome-app', then `rake deploy:production` will
deploy to that application.

Usage:

    rake deploy:setup # this creates and pushes a 'stable' branch to origin

    rake deploy:<name-of-remote> # this pushes to whatever remote you have
                                 # pointing to heroku that you specify.

Specifying a git ref to push
----------------------------

If you rather push a tag or another branch, then specify a environment variable
GIT_REF that points to the ref you want to push. For example:

    rake GIT_REF=v1.0 deploy:production

Will push the tag 'v1.0' to the remote named 'production'
